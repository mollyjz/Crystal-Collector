# Crystals Collector Game

Deployed at https://mollyjz.github.io/week-4-game/

A fun and interactive game for web browsers. Dynamically updates HTML pages using jQuery.

When the game begins, four crystals are displayed as buttons on the page, and the player is shown a random number. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. This amount until the crystal is clicked.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. When the game begins again, a new random number is displayed, and all the crystals will have four new hidden values.
